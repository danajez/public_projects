### Data Gathering
I started to gather data by identifying the data sources required for my project. This involved extracting data from learning database.

### Data Preparation (ETL)
Once I had the data, I performed data cleaning and transformation tasks to ensure its quality and compatibility with Power BI. This included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and applying necessary data type conversions.

### Data Modeling
In Power BI, I created a data model by defining relationships between the different tables in my dataset. This enabled me to combine data from multiple sources and establish meaningful connections between them.
Model view shows all of the tables and columns in the model, and the relationships between them.

### Visualization Design
With the data model in place, I designed visually appealing and informative reports and dashboards. I used Power BI's wide range of visualizations, such as gauge, cards, treemap, charts, and matrix, to represent the data effectively.

### Interactive Features
I enhanced the user experience by adding interactive features to the reports and dashboards. This included slicers, filters, and drill-through functionality, allowing users to explore and analyze the data in a more dynamic and personalized way.
