# [Python Project: Bank`s credit card approval data](https://github.com/danajez/public_projects/blob/main/Python_CC-approval-data/README.md)
---
Project was created to obtain my 'Data Processing and Analysis in Python' certification. 
---
This project is about the process and analysis of data containing information about the bank's clients and their credit card requests. With this project, we simulate a real environment - we have limited knowledge about data, we encounter problems without solutions that weren`t provided to us and no one gives us clear tasks.
