# [Python Project: Bank`s credit card approval data](https://github.com/danajez/public_projects/blob/main/Python_CC-approval-data/README.md)

Project was created to obtain my 'Data Processing and Analysis in Python' certification. 

This project is about the process and analysis of data containing information about the bank's clients and their credit card requests. With this project, we simulate a real environment - we have limited knowledge about data, we encounter problems without solutions that weren`t provided to us and no one gives us clear tasks.

## Check the code itself [here](https://github.com/danajez/public_projects/blob/main/Python_CC-approval-data/CC_approval_data.ipynb).

# [Power BI Project: Revenue and products](https://github.com/danajez/public_projects/blob/main/Power-BI_cert_project/README.md)

Project was created to obtain my 'Power BI' certification.

This project is about putting Power BI report creation knowledge into practice:Â connecting data sources, data cleansing and transformation, model creation, creation of benchmarks, and creating data visualizations.

# Python Project: Playing with Kickstarter - funding platform for creative projects

Project was created to obtain my 'Data Analysis in Python' certification.

This project is about the process and analysis of data containing information about the projects you want to build for people - everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology. The tasks and questions are given by lecturer. All tasks take no more than 3-4 lines of code.

# [SQL Queries - Women SQL Academy](https://github.com/danajez/public_projects/blob/main/SQL_Queries_WSQLA/README.md)

Project was created to obtain my SQL certification as a part of 'Women SQL Academy' course.

The course was focused on practical work with databases: how to work, connect and analyze data in databases using the SQL language, obtaining, inserting and updating data, but also analytical queries or practical commands to facilitate work.

Sample of the questions we had to resolve using SQL queries:
1. Find out which employee in the table EMPLOYEE has the highest salary. (In SELECT use last name and salary).

2. Show names and salaries for non-managers from department D21. In first line will be the original salary, in second row will be salary after 10% increase. There will be only 1 Salary column.

3. Create a list with columns "wordkept, empno, salary" of every employee in department A00. On the last line sum all salaries you see in the view.
