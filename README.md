# [Python Project: Bank`s credit card approval data](https://github.com/danajez/public_projects/blob/main/Python_CC-approval-data/README.md)

Project was created to obtain my 'Data Processing and Analysis in Python' certification. 

This project is about the process and analysis of data containing information about the bank's clients and their credit card requests. With this project, we simulate a real environment - we have limited knowledge about data, we encounter problems without solutions that weren`t provided to us and no one gives us clear tasks.
